great Robert Reich posted new whiteboard video week makes case support Bernie Sanders reacting claims made Bernie Sanders skeptics Democratic voters convinced Bernie Guy. hasten underline Bernie skeptic, Hillary Clinton supporter either, though intend vote either Bernie Hillary June California primary, well Dem nominee general election. Obviously. also like repeat think Reich one great left-wing political thinkers time. obligatory qualifiers way, Reich base several counterpoints Bernie skeptics.Let take look.1) never beat Trump Cruz. Reich response suggests Bernie indeed polling advantage Republicans general election, Clinton. Unfortunately, Politifact determined Bernie version assessment flatly False. Sanders Clinton lead Trump, specifically, general election according NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Sanders trails Marco Rubio Ted Cruz, Clinton performs slightly better. PPP, meanwhile, shows Sanders losing Trump, Cruz Rubio Clinton defeats three. Additionally, crucial understanding general election differences Democratic hopefuls, voters following Hillary Clinton 35 years yet still performs better, scandals all, Sanders GOP polls. Sanders, meanwhile, relative unknown, early tell GOP begins relentlessly attack him.2) Congress would reject ideas. Reich reminds us Congress remains hands Republicans, Hillary Clinton able much legislatively either. Actually, necessarily true. Clinton agenda decidedly moderate, sure run significant GOP opposition, easier shake loose centrist center-right Republicans, well blue dog Democrats would otherwise oppose Sanders significantly leftist ideas.Reich goes say Bernie could bring Democratic majority Congress if! political revolution works out. super-colossal if. First all, revolution year change gerrymandered districts. Secondly, let suppose Sanders rides massive wave support White House long coattails. need roughly 70-seat Democratic majority Senate pass single-payer proposal, example.Why 70 60? Blue dog Democrats. blue dogs successfully killed public option 2009 would surely join Republicans filibustering Bernie single-payer legislation, hence extra 10 votes beyond 60 required break filibuster. Realistically, thing might able spark 70-seat majority (the House totally different story, way) another major financial crisis another groundbreaking event compel voters choose Democratic candidates across board.3) America would never elect socialist. Reich makes off-the-shelf argument many popular socialist programs United States, therefore Americans love socialism. Wrong. American voters love socialism, yes, know do. argument public schools roads used since forever without successfully nudging many voters leftward. Trust me, tried many, many times.Socialism, observed Obama falsely accused pushing 2009, still intensely demonized communism (it not) and, cases, Republicans erroneously conflated Nazis, aka National Socialists. (Just socialism name party founded Hitler mean really socialist. Likewise, hot dogs contain actual dogs.)When Republicans launch relentless attack Sanders democratic-socialist platform, another swift-boating like observed 2004, relentless. undecided moderate voters swing states people decide elections polarized modern era might convinced vote Sanders, long shot. picky, old-fashioned voters states like Pennsylvania Missouri. Bottom line: Softening American voters negative attitudes socialism take much longer nine months.4) single-payer proposal would require raising taxes middle class. Reich Sanders one. bogus argument, pushed skeptics Hillary supporters alike. According Sanders numbers, middle class families would pay less per year healthcare therefore end saving money spite modest tax hike. trouble, however, getting Congress support tax hike middle class. See also #2.5) plan free college tuition would mean colleges would run government rules. heard Democratic skeptics saying this, might missed them. Nevertheless, agree Sanders Reich here. nothing Sanders proposal, Obama two-year-college plan, matter, showing colleges would kowtow federal government.6) old. Reich believes 74 new 64 and, honestly, concerned Bernie age all. long would-be vice presidential nominee strong, non-issue. However, area Republicans use attack Sanders, matter much. John McCain age modestly relevant due battle skin cancer. Sanders, hand, seems quite energetic healthy.So, told, three Reich counterpoints skeptics particularly strong, one counterpoint middle class tax hikes directed hardline pro-Hillary people (not mere skeptics) well Republicans, final two counterpoints arguments really heard coming Bernie skeptics.All all, still seems like Sanders victory subsequent Sanders presidency would long shot. impossible, risky standpoint overcoming significant electoral political hurdles, well current status (obscenely gerrymandered) Congress. Democrats ultimately decide whether Sanders agenda worth risking possible Republican victory November.// ![CDATA[ // ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) var js, fjs d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; (d.getElementById(id)) return; js d.createElement(s); js.id id; js.src "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]>Bernie skepticsHow respond Bernie skeptics?
